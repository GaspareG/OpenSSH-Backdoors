	Very difficult to determine the infection vector used to install these OpenSSH backdoors.
	
	\medskip
	
	In the operation Windigo two different vector was used: 
	
	\smallskip
	
	An attack of the website \textit{kernel.org} (the official repository of the linux kernel source code) to inject malicious code.
	
	\smallskip
	
	An attack to \textit{cpanel.net}, the most famous software to manage websites and hosting.

  \medskip
  
  Obvious but important recommendation is to install software only from trusted sources, e.g. checks sources in \textsc{/etc/apt/sources.list} for debian-derived linux distribution or install only trusted package from the AUR (Arch User Repository) for ArchLinux distribution.
